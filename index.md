## sigmaclientwastaken's client list
There have recently been lots of client lists on the [MinecraftClients Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/minecraftclients), \
so I decided to make my own. \
If you find any issues, open an [issue on the GitHub page](https://github.com/sigmaclientwastaken/clients-list/issues)! \
NOTE: The list is not done and I will keep updating it.
